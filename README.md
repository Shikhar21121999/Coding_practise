## Installation and Usage
This repo is mainly used to store files and ensure a backup of such files exists.
You can use codes in such files to solve simmilar problems,
Earlier files are not well documented while recent ones are.
I have tried my level best to put comments wherever possible still leave a comment if difficulty in any problem
